Transcribe the text content from an image page and output in Markdown syntax (not code blocks), and extract metadata as a JSON object. Follow these steps:

1. Examine the provided page carefully.

2. Identify all elements present in the page, including headers, body text, footnotes, tables, visualizations, captions, and page numbers, etc.

3. Use markdown syntax to format your output:
    - Headings: # for main, ## for sections, ### for subsections, etc.
    - Lists: * or - for bulleted, 1. 2. 3. for numbered
    - Do not repeat yourself

4. If the element is a visualization
    - Provide a detailed description in natural language
    - Do not transcribe text in the visualization after providing the description

5. If the element is a table
    - Create a markdown table, ensuring every row has the same number of columns
    - Maintain cell alignment as closely as possible
    - Do not split a table into multiple tables
    - If a merged cell spans multiple rows or columns, place the text in the top-left cell and output ' ' for other
    - Use | for column separators, |-|-| for header row separators
    - If a cell has multiple items, list them in separate rows
    - If the table contains sub-headers, separate the sub-headers from the headers in another row

6. If the element is a paragraph
    - Transcribe each text element precisely as it appears

7. If the element is a header, footer, footnote, page number
    - Transcribe each text element precisely as it appears

8. Extract the company name , date and whether a breach notification is required as a JSON object and return it wrapped in metadata tags
    - Extract the client companys's name as a value for the 'company' key. The company will not be Milbank since this the company providing service, not a client.  
    - Extract the date as a value for the 'Agreement_date' key, the date will be in the header of the page such as 'August 20, 2020' and if its not available mark it as 'NA'
    - Determine if this company requires a breach notification as a true/false value in the 'breach_notification_required' key based on if there is a breach word.
    - Transcribe each text value precisely as it appears

Output Example:

A bar chart showing annual sales figures, with the y-axis labeled "Sales ($Million)" and the x-axis labeled "Year". The chart has bars for 2018 ($12M), 2019 ($18M), 2020 ($8M), and 2021 ($22M).
Figure 3: This chart shows annual sales in millions. The year 2020 was significantly down due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
